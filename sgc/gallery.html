    <p><!-- Description of activity -->
        On September 11th, I went to a bioblitz event in the Guilford Woods. A bioblitz is an event where people try to
        find a lot of species in a specific area in a short period of time. The bioblitz I participated in was located
        at Guilford Woods, a small 15 acre remnant of a forest at the edge of the University. I spent a couple hours at
        the event, documenting various insects and plant species as part of the Anacostia watershed's society
        program.</p>
